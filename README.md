# Speed-reader-web-Application
AI web app/browser extension/tool 

    This feature can display any book, webpage, PDF, word, etc., in fast reading mode.
     It may be a website page of the TestCrack.org page option or added as an extension to a browser. (Need to check the viability and cost) 
    The chunking quantity can be controlled by the user in settings. 

This means the number of words together that prompt to read by the user can be increased or decreased by the settings or automatically by:- 

Option 1.

It should also have a manual control that can be set by a user by asking him at the moment when he tries to pause or goes back to read again.   

    The speed of the forward reading is also controllable in the above manner
    The keywords should be left darker than others but less dark than the content that he currently reading and the reader has the option to select those important points and the database will remember that for other students who are going to use it later.

 

    After each page or specific chapter of reading, the app will generate a crisp summary for him
    To test his comprehension and attention span, the app generates questions based on the content after a 90-second or less reading time. (700-100 words). Based on the answers, the system will adjust its

To create a Python-based web app or browser extension that can display any book, webpage, PDF, Word, or other content in a fast reading mode, several components need to be developed. The Python code for such a tool would include text extraction, chunking, speed control, keyword highlighting, summarization, and user interactions for comprehension testing.

Here’s a high-level breakdown of the features and the basic Python code to get started with such a tool.
Requirements:

    Text Extraction: Extract content from webpages, PDFs, and Word documents.
    Chunking: Break down the content into manageable chunks of words.
    Speed Control: Adjust the speed at which the content is displayed.
    Keyword Highlighting: Highlight keywords differently.
    Summary Generation: Generate a summary of the read content.
    Comprehension Testing: Generate questions based on the text content.
    User Interactions: Allow for manual and automatic adjustments based on user feedback.

Step 1: Set up the environment

Install necessary Python libraries:

pip install nltk beautifulsoup4 pdfminer.six python-docx

Step 2: Extract Text from Webpage, PDF, and Word Documents

You'll need to extract content from various sources like PDFs, Word documents, or webpages. For simplicity, we'll use basic libraries to handle different formats.

import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
from pdfminer.high_level import extract_text
import docx

# Function to extract text from a webpage
def extract_text_from_webpage(url):
    response = requests.get(url)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
    text = soup.get_text()
    return text

# Function to extract text from a PDF
def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file):
    text = extract_text(pdf_file)
    return text

# Function to extract text from a Word document
def extract_text_from_word(docx_file):
    doc = docx.Document(docx_file)
    text = "\n".join([para.text for para in doc.paragraphs])
    return text

Step 3: Chunk the Text and Control Speed

This step involves chunking the text into manageable pieces and allowing the user to control how many words are displayed at once and the speed of forward reading.

import time

def chunk_text(text, chunk_size=100):
    # Split the text into words and divide it into chunks
    words = text.split()
    chunks = [words[i:i + chunk_size] for i in range(0, len(words), chunk_size)]
    return chunks

def display_chunk(chunk, speed=1):
    # Join the chunk into a string and simulate reading
    text = " ".join(chunk)
    print(text)
    time.sleep(speed)  # Adjust speed with the time.sleep function

Step 4: Keyword Highlighting

For keyword highlighting, you can use a simple technique of replacing keywords with HTML tags or different formatting.

import re

def highlight_keywords(text, keywords):
    for keyword in keywords:
        text = re.sub(rf'\b{keyword}\b', f'<b>{keyword}</b>', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)
    return text

Step 5: Summarization

Generate a summary using an NLP library like nltk. The simplest way to summarize could be extracting the first few sentences or using more advanced techniques like TextRank or LDA for topic modeling.

import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

def summarize_text(text, num_sentences=3):
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    summary = " ".join(sentences[:num_sentences])
    return summary

Step 6: Comprehension Testing

You can generate simple questions based on the text. One approach could be to randomly select sentences and create questions related to them. You can improve this by using more sophisticated methods later, like question generation models.

import random

def generate_questions(text):
    sentences = sent_tokenize(text)
    question = random.choice(sentences)  # Simple example of generating a question
    return f"What is the main idea of the following sentence?\n{question}?"

Step 7: Interaction and Adjustments

For user interaction, you can collect input using Python’s input() for a simple console application or integrate this with a web framework (Flask/Django) or a browser extension to get real-time feedback from the user.

def adjust_reading_behavior(user_input, current_behavior):
    # Example of adjusting chunk size or reading speed based on input
    if user_input == "increase speed":
        current_behavior['speed'] -= 0.1  # Increase speed
    elif user_input == "decrease speed":
        current_behavior['speed'] += 0.1  # Decrease speed
    elif user_input == "increase chunk size":
        current_behavior['chunk_size'] += 10  # Increase chunk size
    elif user_input == "decrease chunk size":
        current_behavior['chunk_size'] -= 10  # Decrease chunk size
    return current_behavior

Step 8: Browser Extension (Basic Setup)

To create a browser extension, you would need to create a manifest.json and background scripts to handle the user interactions.

manifest.json

{
  "manifest_version": 2,
  "name": "Fast Reading Tool",
  "description": "A tool to speed up reading and improve comprehension",
  "version": "1.0",
  "permissions": ["activeTab"],
  "browser_action": {
    "default_popup": "popup.html",
    "default_icon": "icon.png"
  },
  "background": {
    "scripts": ["background.js"],
    "persistent": false
  }
}

popup.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Fast Reading Tool</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Fast Reading Settings</h1>
    <button id="startReading">Start Reading</button>
    <input type="number" id="chunkSize" value="100">
    <input type="number" id="speed" value="1">
    <script src="popup.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>

popup.js

document.getElementById('startReading').addEventListener('click', function() {
  let chunkSize = document.getElementById('chunkSize').value;
  let speed = document.getElementById('speed').value;
  chrome.tabs.executeScript({
    code: 'startReading(' + chunkSize + ',' + speed + ')'
  });
});

background.js

chrome.browserAction.onClicked.addListener(function(tab) {
  chrome.tabs.executeScript(tab.id, { file: 'content.js' });
});

Conclusion

This basic setup gives you a starting point for creating a fast reading app or browser extension. It includes text extraction, chunking, speed control, keyword highlighting, summarization, and simple comprehension testing. You can further enhance these features with more advanced AI models for question generation, adaptive reading behavior, and feedback-driven adjustments.

For a large-scale deployment, you'd need to:

    Implement a cloud-based backend (e.g., using Flask, Django, or FastAPI) to store data and provide summaries or feedback.
    Integrate the tool with machine learning models for more sophisticated comprehension analysis and feedback.
    Develop the browser extension and optimize its performance for real-world usage.
